    <p>Food insecurity has serious impacts on an individualâ€™s well-being, which may result in poor school attendance and performance, lowered workplace productivity, and physical and mental health problems. Individuals struggling with food insecurity have to make tough decisions that no one should face. No family should have to decide between buying groceries or paying rent, no senior should have to choose between food and medicine, and no parent should have to skip a meal in order for their children to eat.</p>
    <p>InFood aims to connect people with food insecurity with caterers, restaurants, grocery stores that have leftover food.</p>
