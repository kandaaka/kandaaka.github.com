            <h2>About Media Queries</h2>
            <p>Media queries are used to specify what rules or properties should be used depending on the size. There are two types of media queries the min width and the max width. The min width means that when the size is equal to or more than the size specified in the query the properties under the min width query will be implemented. While the max width media query implements its properties if the size of the window is equal to or less than the size indicated. When designing a website we usually start with the mobile version so that we can focus on including all the information and not getting side tracked by the designing aspect as the mobile version is less complicated and everything is ordered.</p>

            <h2>Relative Units</h2>
            <p>We use relative units because it keeps the sizes of different elements proportional to the parent element or in this case proportional to the media query size or window size. There are different relative units, one of them is em which is relative to the font size of the element. Another example is percentage and it is relative to the same property as the parent element.</p>

            <h2>Meta Viewport Tag</h2>
            <p>The meta viewport tag gives the browser instructions on how to set up the dimensions and size of the page. The viewport is the screen that has the content that is visible to the user, it varies depending on the size of the device. Not having the tag will lead to the content in the page zooming in out of proportion.</p>
