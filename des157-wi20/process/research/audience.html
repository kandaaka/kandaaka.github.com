    <h1>User Research</h1>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <img src="images/persona.jpg" width="600" height="790" alt="personas for research"> 

    <p class="para">1- One of the people going to be affected by this is the people volunteering to pick up and drop off the food in their free time.</p>

    <p class="para">2- Other groups that will be participating in this are the restaurants and grocery store owners and workers in the area. They will have to use the application to say that they have extra food that needs to be picked up.</p>

    <p class="para">3- The homeless population and people in need will also be affected as they will be receiving the food and hopefully this will help decrease food insecurity, specifically in the Bay Area.</p>

    <p class="para">4- Finally, sponsors and people that donate money will also be using this application to support the people that volunteer to drive and pick up food and the nutrition of the homeless people.</p>


    <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
    

    <p class="para">I think that one of the strengths that my project has is that it aims to provide nutrition for all and reduce food waste around us. This will benefit the people who struggle to find food. It also creates unity within the community.</p>

    <p class="para">I think that one of the main weaknesses of this project is that it will be difficult to find people that will be willing to pick up and drop off food voluntarily -- at least in the beginning. It will also be difficult to find a place that can be rented out/ used to repackage the food and distribute it.  For that, I would probably have to communicate and coordinate with existing food banks.</p>

    <p class="para">This project has the ability to decrease food insecurities and encourage people to give back to the community. It can be something that one of the food delivery services offer or incorporate into their company. I think that working with other local food bank and soup kitchen organizations will definitely help launch this project and make it successful.</p>

    <p class="para">One of the biggest threats is probably not getting enough people/ restaurants interested in helping out. We must form really good relationships with the owners and workers in order to convince them to use the application to have the extra food picked up. Many people may not be interested in working with this idea as it is not profitable so there has to be an incentive. One must play on emotions when trying to convince people.</p>

    <p class="para">I wasn’t able to get interviews but based on the research I did I found a lot of articles that cited the problems and food insecurities within the Bay Area. Many families struggle to maintain the cost of living and provide proper nutrition. In addition, I have seen first-hand restaurants and coffee shops like Starbucks throw out all their leftover food at the end of the day. I think that a lot of companies wouldn’t be willing to support the cause in the beginning as it is not benefitting them. I did talk to my uncle and he said that he would be willing to deliver and that there is a big need for an application like this as there is a lot of food that goes to waste and many people that go to sleep without having the proper nutrition.</p>
