    <h1> Academic Research</h1>

    <p class="para">For my academic research, I looked into several articles and websites the discuss the hunger that has stricken many of the Bay Area residents. The organization “Second Harvest of Silicon Valley” published a post in 2018 that discusses several reasons why many residents go hungry. The post cites many articles, one of which is the “San Francisco Chronicles” which highlights the different groups like college students, undocumented families, and seniors that struggle to get food due to the rising cost of living. The website notes that the opportunity for lower-wage jobs has increased while the proportion of middle and upper wage jobs declined dramatically in the past 20 years. One of the greatly affected counties is San Mateo County where the lowest-income renters spend up to two-thirds of their income on rent, leaving little left for food, transportation, health care, and other essentials. Nutrition plays an essential role in a person’s life. Households that don’t get proper nutrition can be caught in a vicious cycle of poverty, food insecurity and poor health. Fresh produce, lean protein, and other healthy foods are expensive and sometimes hard to get. The lack of access to nutrient-rich foods is hurting those who can’t afford them. Without nutritious food, adults face higher rates of diseases like diabetes, and seniors risk malnutrition.</p>

    <p class="para">The second website, “Loaves and Fishes”, says that after the recovery from the recession in the Bay Area, rent has gone up by double the amount that income has led to an increase in poverty. Many of the families in the Bay Area have to work multiple jobs or live with other families in order to afford to pay for housing. The low-income families that are able to afford some food are mainly able to get high calorie, unhealthy, and cheap food because it is easy to prepare and costs less. In addition, many of the individuals that are suffering are kids, who don’t receive enough nutrition and may fall ill. This will require families to pay high medical bills to treat the child. The hunger index keeps on increasing year by year and many of the food banks aren’t able to assist and provide meals for all the families. I think that companies and wealthy people in the area should step in and help provide for the families that have suffered in the community. One of the biggest factors that led to an increase in hunger rates and poverty is the bloom of the tech industry and the increase in living expenses.</p>

    <p class="para">The last article I took a look at was CBS SF Bay Area’s article “SF Has High Rate Of ‘Food Insecurity’ Despite Increased Spending”. The article said that the health officials had planned to eliminate hunger from San Francisco by 2020 but the numbers have just continued to increase. Although the city has increased its funding, that hasn’t done much as the living expenses have increased dramatically in the past couple of years. The article discusses the importance of local contribution and donations because everyone needs to be involved in order to end hunger and food insecurity. One thing that a staff member at a community kitchen said was “With the tents, the food, the drug addiction…it takes a whole village to change the situation we’re in now.” That I think is very essential and everyone must contribute and that is the goal of the interactive website that I will be having. It will make it easier and simpler to contribute to feeding the community.</p>
