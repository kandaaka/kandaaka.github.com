    <h2>UberEats</h2>
    <img src="images/UberEats.png" width="1034" height="730" alt="picture of UberEats" title="ubereats.com screen capture"> 

    <p class="para">I think that the app achieves its main goal easily by getting people to order food and get their food delivered to them. There are some issues with usability since it is difficult to complete some tasks like preordering. The pathway for that is hidden and isn’t easily found.</p>

    <p class="para">This product has a similar goal like mine which is food delivery. UberEats aims to serve the middle class and the higher class people that are able to pay for delivery and food. I think that the app successfully helps people order although the UI might not be the easiest to use for many.  The application connects restaurants, drivers, and the customer receiving the food as all the people can track and see exactly where and what is going on.</p>

    <p class="para">I think that this application is a lot more user-friendly and trusted than the other food delivery applications. The application has also got rid of the sort by an option to maximize the user experience. UberEats now provides an all in the search bar so users can search restaurants, keyword or dish names and get the list of restaurants. They also have different categories of food to choose from. There is also an estimated delivery time and how expensive a restaurant is, making it easier for the user to see which suit their preference. Although UberEats does show the pricing and delivery time, large images are a prominent part of selling the food making the loading time a bit longer. Another downside of UberEats is that the main page usually shows the same restaurants leading to a lack of diversity. Although it can be debated that fewer choices make it easier for the customer to choose a specific restaurant.</p>

    <p class="para">My application/ website will be similar to this, but with a different target audience - people who can’t afford food and basic nutrition. It won’t necessarily be taking orders but rather restaurants and people will be on the website to place an order for pickup of their food that is leftover or to sponsor people in need of food.</p>


    <h2>DoorDash</h2>
    <img src="images/DoorDash.png" width="1030" height="729" alt="picture of DoorDash" title="doordash.com screen capture"> 

    <p class="para">DoorDash, another food delivery application is very popular and in-demand. Although it has many features like sort/ filter and many restaurants, it is very difficult for users to find a restaurant that is to their liking.</p>

    <p class="para">Unlike UberEats DoorDash also uses the same technique as UberEats, having images for each restaurant. Other than the loading time, I think that DoorDash is very helpful and easy to use as it has categories at the top with not only different cuisines but also a filter option with vegetarian and pricing. The application is also easy to use as they include the rating and the delivery fee on the main page. The application also lets you know what time each restaurant stops accepting orders which is very helpful. There was one time that I ordered using postmates and I wasn’t notified about when the restaurant stops accepting orders. I got a notification after the restaurant closed saying that I will receive a refund and that the restaurant stopped accepting orders.</p>

    <p class="para">When restaurants are closed they are faded out so that one can know that the application actually has that restaurant but it isn’t available at the time. You can also filter/ sort using several filter options making it easier to specify what one wants.</p>

    <p class="para">I think that overall the application does a good job in helping the users purchase food and it has improved significantly, making the process less frustrating. The targetted audience is similar to that of UberEats and I think that it accomplishes the mission of providing a user-friendly service. I think one of the things that is brought into question is ethics and whether the drivers get paid enough. There have been studies that show that the food delivery companies aren’t obligated to pay drivers minimum wage since they are contractors.</p>
