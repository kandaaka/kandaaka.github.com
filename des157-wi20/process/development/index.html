    <p id="para">The brainstorming helped me process and further develop on the ideas I had started off with. I was mainly focused on the cost that comes with technological advances and how that increases the socioeconomical gap. This leads to the lack of inclusion. The aspect that I focused on is the need for shelter and the increase number of homeless people precisely in the Bay Area. I came up with the idea of having either Airbnb have housing specifically for homeless people or having the houses that aren't booked open to people to sleep in. These nights can be sponsored by tech companies. I also thought of having UberEats but for people in need of food. My final idea was getting rid of the bro culture surrounding the tech field. This can be done by promoting and sponsoring minorities and women to enter the tech field.</p>
